# Electricity-Billing-System-Using-Java
This is our OOP project develop in java using netbeans IDE.

Assumptions & constraints:
Assumptions are that this program will be fully functional, and we will extend it so that it can work
for large electricity board like K electric but it is also a constraint that due to our small knowledge and less
budget it would be difficult we will not be able to make it as big as we think but we have managed to create
it to be used for small or medium scale electricity boards. Lack of time was also major constraint, thus it was
not possible to make the software foolproof and dynamic.
